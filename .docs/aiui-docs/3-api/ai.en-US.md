# AI

AIUI is designed for AI application development. Its most common capabilities can be grouped into three areas: understanding what the user says, speaking the result back, and directly invoking a large language model for understanding, reasoning, and generation.

If you are building a complete voice agent, you will typically combine these three capabilities:

- **Speech Recognition**: Converts what the user says into text.
- **Large Language Model**: Understands the context and generates a reply.
- **Speech Synthesis**: Reads the generated result back to the user.

## How To Choose

- Want your app to understand user input: use `Speech Recognition`
- Want your app to speak text aloud: use `Speech Synthesis`
- Want your app to perform Q&A, summarization, generation, or reasoning: use `Large Language Model`

## Simple Example

For example, first check whether the model capability is available, then send a prompt:

```javascript
const status = await LanguageModel.availability();

if (status === 'available') {
  const session = await LanguageModel.create();

  const result = await session.prompt('请用一句话介绍 AIUI');
  console.log(result);
}
```
