# Media

AIUI media capabilities cover sound effect playback, audio playback, and device media interaction. For local short sound effects such as button clicks and prompts, you can usually start with `Sound`; for taking photos, camera interaction, or voice capture, continue with the camera and recorder documents. This page does not expand on every API detail. Its main purpose is to help you quickly find the specific docs related to sound effects, audio, recording, and camera features.

## Simple Example

For example, play a button click sound effect:

```javascript
const click = new Sound('./click.wav');
click.volume = 0.8;
click.play();
```
