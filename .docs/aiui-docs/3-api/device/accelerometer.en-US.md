# Accelerometer

The accelerometer is used to read acceleration changes along the device's three axes. It is suitable for detecting movement, shaking, gait, and pose change trends.

In AIUI, `Accelerometer` follows a usage pattern close to the Generic Sensor API: create an instance, listen for events, start sampling, and stop sampling.

## Use Cases

- Motion detection
- Shake interactions
- Device state awareness
- Spatial interaction decisions combined with other sensors

## Entry

```javascript
const sensor = new Accelerometer({ frequency: 60 });
```

## Basic Example

```javascript
const sensor = new Accelerometer({ frequency: 60 });

sensor.addEventListener('activate', (event) => {
  console.log('accelerometer active', event.sessionId);
});

sensor.addEventListener('reading', () => {
  console.log(sensor.x, sensor.y, sensor.z, sensor.timestamp);
});

sensor.addEventListener('error', (event) => {
  console.error(event.error, event.message);
});

sensor.start();
```

## Common Properties

### `x` / `y` / `z`
- **Type**: `number | null`
- **Description**: Acceleration readings on the three axes; the value is `null` until the first valid reading arrives.

### `timestamp`
- **Type**: `number | null`
- **Description**: The timestamp of the most recent reading.

### `activated`
- **Type**: `boolean`
- **Description**: Whether the sensor is currently active.

### `hasReading`
- **Type**: `boolean`
- **Description**: Whether at least one valid reading has been received.

## Common Methods

### `start()`
- Starts a new sampling session.

### `stop()`
- Stops the current sampling session; if already stopped, it is a no-op.

## Recommendations

- If you only need basic motion detection, start with a lower frequency to avoid unnecessary sampling overhead.
- Read `sensor.x`, `sensor.y`, and `sensor.z` inside the `reading` event, and do not assume values are available immediately after instantiation.
- Call `stop()` promptly when the page changes, the feature is turned off, or the sensor is no longer needed.
- More complex pose estimation usually requires combining the accelerometer with an orientation sensor or gyroscope.
