# v0.1.1

## Runtime APIs
- **Device Serial Number**: Added `navigator.getDeviceSerialNumber()` to obtain the device SN.
- **Device Identification Info**: Added `navigator.userAgent` to return device and version information.
- **Streaming Audio Playback**: `AudioPlayer` now supports Opus streaming playback, allowing Ogg-container Opus audio streams to be appended by explicitly declaring `format: 'ogg_opus'`.

## UI Rendering
- **Fixed Positioning**: CSS now supports `position: fixed` for floating and fixed-layout scenarios.

## Components and Charts
- **scroll-view**: Fixed component rendering issues and improved display stability for scroll containers.
- **chart**: Fixed several issues in chart components and improved rendering and usability.
