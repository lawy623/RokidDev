## 💡 Why this exists

Rokid projects are still scattered across personal repos, prototypes, hackathon builds, and side experiments.

This repo collects them in one clean index so developers, tinkerers, and curious users can:

- discover real apps for Rokid glasses
- find inspiration for their own builds
- track what is already possible on the platform
- share new projects with the community

> This is a community list, not an official Rokid catalog.

---

## 📐 Scope

Projects listed here should match at least one of these:

- native apps that run directly on Rokid glasses
- phone plus glasses companion systems
- launchers, HUDs, utilities, or media tools for Rokid devices
- server or bridge projects built specifically for a Rokid workflow
- SDKs, documentation, or developer resources that help people build for Rokid
- serious experiments that help push the ecosystem forward
